# Useless Gaps

Useless Gaps is a GNOME Shell Extension that displays currently configured
Gnome hotkeys in a popup. The popup is activated with <kbd>Super + S</kbd>.

*Only tested with Gnome 40*. It might run correctly with other versions.

Currently it only shows some of the window manager shortcuts. In the future
versions it should show personally configured shortcuts.
